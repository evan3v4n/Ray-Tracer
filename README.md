# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Book One

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and accompanying explanation for the first book in the Ray Tracing in One Weekend series. The book introduces the fundamental concepts of ray tracing, an image rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to achieve photo-realistic graphics.

## Code
The code within this repository is written in C++, structured to closely follow the progression of the book. Each chapter's code reflects the development of a ray tracer from scratch, building up in complexity and feature set.

## Concepts
Key concepts covered include:
- Basic ray tracing algorithms
- Ray-surface intersection
- Shading and materials
- Anti-aliasing
- Defining simple geometric objects
- Camera modeling

## Usage
To run the ray tracer:
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile main.cc.
3. Execute the program with ./(exec file name) > (image file).ppm

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Peter Shirley for authoring the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book. This work has been instrumental in guiding me through the intricate process of learning and implementing ray tracing algorithms. Peter's clear explanations and step-by-step approach have made complex concepts accessible and engaging. His contributions to the field of computer graphics are truly appreciated, and this project stands as a testament to the educational value of his work.
